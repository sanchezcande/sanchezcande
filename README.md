### Hi there 👋
I'm Cande, a passionate software developer with experience in building web applications using technologies like React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. While most of my work has been in proprietary projects for companies, I'm excited to contribute to open source projects and share my knowledge with the community. My focus lies in frontend development, where I leverage React as my primary library, and I enjoy working with JavaScript and TypeScript to craft modern and scalable web applications. I'm always eager to learn and explore new ideas, techniques, and tools to further enhance my skills as a developer. Thank you for visiting my profile, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate on a project.
